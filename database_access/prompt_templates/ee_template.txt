Your task is to produce canonical entity strings for subjects/objects and basic aliases.

Rules:
- Normalize minor punctuation and whitespace.
- Keep person names as written unless there's an obvious duplicate (case-only).
- Provide {"canonical":"...", "aliases":["...","..."]}.

INPUT TRIPLES:
{triples}

Return JSON:
{"entities":[{"canonical":"Haitham Hawashin","aliases":["HAITHAM HAWASHIN"]}, ...]}
