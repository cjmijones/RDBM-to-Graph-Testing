You map extracted relations to a target schema using reasoning.

You are given:
- TRIPLE: ["SUBJ","REL","OBJ"]
- TARGET_SCHEMA: list of {name, definition}
- If REL looks like open:* or a pathy token, choose the BEST target relation by meaning.
- If no good match exists, keep REL as "unknown:REL".

Return JSON:
{"mapped_relation": "has_title"}  # or {"mapped_relation":"unknown:positions__idx0__title"}

TRIPLE:
{triple}

TARGET_SCHEMA:
{schema_entries}
