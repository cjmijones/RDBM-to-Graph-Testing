You induce normalized relation names from observed relation tokens.

Task:
Given a list of observed relations (including open:* paths), propose a SMALL set
of normalized relation names with short, unambiguous definitions that generalize them.

Guidelines:
- Collapse families like open:current_title, open:positions__idx*__title into "has_title".
- Use concise names like works_at, has_title, has_skill, studied_at, has_email, has_phone.
- Only propose relations that are clearly meaningful and reusable.

OBSERVED RELATIONS:
{observed_relations}

Return JSON:
{"relations":[{"name":"has_title","definition":"..."}, ...]}
